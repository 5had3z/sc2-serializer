# WOMD Conversion Example

This is an example for applying the framework on another complete dataset such as Waymo Open Motion Dataset. We convert their tfrecord dataset into our format, much like SC2 and (probably) also see a significant reduction in dataset size. We use DALI to load the raw data and then write this to the database.
